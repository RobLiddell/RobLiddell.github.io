			<h1><strong>Nonlinear Analysis of Nano- and Micro- scale Topographies on Dental Implant Anchorage Tested in Shear and Tension</strong></h1>
			<h3>By: Robert Liddell</h3>
			<h3>2017</h3>

			<h2>Goal</h2>
			<p>Determine the effect implant topography has on the growth of bone anchorage.</p>
			<h3>Background</h3>
			<p>Dental implants are treated in many different ways in an attempt to
				improve bone growth around them and increase bone anchorage. The better
				the implant is anchored by bone the less likely the implant is to
				experience mobility and loosen with time which would require revision. A
				commonly employed method of implant treatment are additive or
				subtractive process which increase implant topographical complexity.
				This study looked at the effect of adding nanoscale features to a
				microtopographically complex surface. Furthermore, a majority of studies
				focus on a narrow time scale. This study looked at implant anchorage
				over a 6 month time frame.
			</p>
			<h2>Summary of Data</h2>
			<p>The study was designed to place 240 implants (120/implant group) into
				120 rats. with each implant being tested twice due to the lateral and
				medial arches this would result in 480 different test files if all
				samples were tested. These 480 different tests would be split between
				the 2 testing methods (Shear/Tension), 2 implant types (BAE/BAE+DCD), 2
				arches (Lateral/Medial), 2 animal sides (Left/Right) and 6 time points
				(5/9/14/28/84/168 days). To simplify analysis this study will use the
				mean of the two arches, dropping samples which do not have both
				arches.

			<p>The graph below shows the distribution of data from the different
				implant groups, testing methods, and time points. It is evident from
				this figure that the data is heteroskedastic with the range of the data
				getting larger at later points in time. It is also evident that BAE+DCD
				implants have greater anchorage than the BAE implants, particularly at
				early time points.

			<h2>Growth Curves</h2>
			<p>Plotting the mean of anchorage (Figure 2.) of each time point on a
				linear axis for time we can note that after an initial rapid increase in
				anchorage, growth rate slows and appears to reach a plateau. This is
				mirrored in Figure 3. which indicates the mean growth rates between each
				time point.
			</p>
			<img src="images\ST1\Growth Rates-1.png", class="image centered"/>
			<p>The growth rates show that there is an initial peak in the rate of
				growth in anchorage between 5 and 9 days, after which anchorage growth
				slows down significantly. While the trends between the two testing
				methods are similar the BAE+DCD implant has a higher peak growth in
				anchorage compared to the BAE implant.

			<h2>Non-linear Modeling</h2>
			<p>This pattern of growth is characteristic of asymptotic growth. This
				includes a number of potential models but for simplicity I used the
				following function: <span class="math display">\[Anchorage=C \times
				\left(1 - e^\dfrac{-Time}{\tau}\right)\]</span> This function was fit to
				each experimental group individually in Figure 4. The horizontal lines
				indicate the value of C, which is the eventual plateau level of the
				curve. The dashed vertical lines are the value of <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> (tau), and indicate how quickly
				anchorage grows. Larger values of C indicate greater overall anchorage,
				and smaller values of <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> indicate
				shorter times required for this anchorage to be achieved. Analysis was
				one by taking 10000 bootstrap samples of the data and using the
				nonlinear least squares method to fit the data. C and <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> terms were extracted and used to
				calculate 95% confidence intervals for the curves of best fit (Figure
				4.) as well as the individual parameters (Figure 5).

			<h2>Conclusions</h2>
			<p>I found that the addition of nanotopography significantly decreases the time 
				required for implants to become securly anchored through a combination of 
				faster rate of healing and stronger overall anchorage. </p>
